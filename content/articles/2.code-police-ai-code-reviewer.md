# CodePolice: AI-Powered Code Review for Bitbucket Repositories

A few months ago, I found myself drowning in pull requests. As a developer, I understand the importance of thorough code reviews, but reviewing each pull request manually was time-consuming and often inconsistent. Sometimes, minor issues slipped through the cracks, and at other times, reviews took longer than necessary.

Then a thought struck me: why not use AI to review pull requests?

CodePolice was born out of our company-organized hackathon, where I worked on building an AI-powered solution to automate code reviews. Seeing the potential of AI in streamlining pull request evaluations, I developed CodePolice to make the process faster, more efficient, and consistent.

## Introducing CodePolice üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

CodePolice is an AI-powered code review bot designed to maintain high code quality standards for Bitbucket repositories. By leveraging cutting-edge AI models like Anthropic Claude, CodePolice analyzes pull requests, provides intelligent feedback, and even determines whether to approve the changes or request modifications.

Key Features:

* **Automated AI Code Reviews** ‚Äî Runs comprehensive reviews using multiple AI models.
* **Seamless Bitbucket Integration** ‚Äî Hooks directly into pull request workflows.
* **Customizable Review Criteria** ‚Äî Tailor rules and checks based on project needs.
* **Multi-Language Support** ‚Äî Works with various programming languages.
* **Automated Approval or Change Requests** ‚Äî Speeds up review cycles with smart decisions.

## How CodePolice Works

Setting up CodePolice is simple:

1. Clone the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SanthoshSiddegowda/code-police-ai)
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up API keys of Anthropic Claude
4. Run the server and configure Bitbucket webhooks
5. Let AI handle your pull request reviews!

Whenever a new pull request is submitted, CodePolice:

* Analyzes the changes using AI models
* Adds comments with relevant feedback
* Approve or request changes based on pre-configured rules

This ensures faster reviews, consistent feedback, and an overall improvement in code quality.


## Why CodePolice?
Traditional code reviews can be slow and inconsistent. CodePolice offers:

* **Speed**: AI-powered analysis completes in seconds, reducing manual effort.
* **Consistency**: Objective, rule-based reviews eliminate human bias.
* **Scalability**: Handles multiple pull requests simultaneously without bottlenecks.
* **Customization**: Fine-tune AI feedback to align with your coding standards.

By automating code reviews, developers can focus more on writing great code instead of spending hours on repetitive review tasks.

##The Future of AI-Powered Code Reviews
With CodePolice, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how AI can transform the development workflow. But this is just the beginning! Future improvements will include:

* **Support for GitHub & GitLab integration**
* **More AI models for enhanced accuracy**
* **Advanced code style enforcement**
* **Interactive feedback loops for developers**

If you‚Äôre tired of spending too much time on code reviews, give CodePolice a try and let AI handle the heavy lifting!
