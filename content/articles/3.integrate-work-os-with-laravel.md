# Integrating WorkOS with Laravel

Integrating WorkOS with Laravel enhances your application's authentication capabilities, offering features like social logins, passkeys, and Single Sign-On (SSO). Laravel  provides starter kits for React, Vue, and Livewire, each with a WorkOS AuthKit variant, simplifying the integration process.

### Getting Started with WorkOS and Laravel Integration

**1. Install Laravel**

Begin by installing Laravel  using the Laravel installer. If you haven't updated the installer recently, do so with:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Next, create a new Laravel project:

```bash
laravel new my-app
```
During setup, you'll be prompted to select a starter kit. Choose your preferred frontend framework (React, Vue, or Livewire) and opt for the WorkOS AuthKit variant when asked. 

**2.  Configure WorkOS in Laravel**

After installation, configure your environment variables with your WorkOS API credentials. Update your `.env` file with the following:

```js
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_XXXXXXXXX
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXX
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8000/authenticate
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual WorkOS credentials

**3: Set Up Redirects in WorkOS**

In your WorkOS dashboard, configure the redirect URIs:

* Sign-in callback: `http://localhost:8000/authenticate`
* App homepage URL: `http://localhost:8000/`
* Logout redirect URL: `http://localhost:8000/`

Ensure these URLs match your application's routes. 

**4: Customize Authentication Methods**

Within the WorkOS AuthKit settings, disable the "Email + Password" authentication if you prefer users to authenticate solely via social providers, passkeys, Magic Auth, or SSO. This approach enhances security by eliminating password handling within your application. 

**5: Align Session Timeouts**

To maintain session consistency, configure the AuthKit session inactivity timeout to match your Laravel application's session timeout settings. 


**6: Launch the Application**

Start your Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Access your application at http://localhost:8000/ to verify the integration. The authentication system should now support WorkOS features seamlessly.
